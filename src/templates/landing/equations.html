            <p> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Regulation (NUREG-1940) titled
                RASCAL 4: Description of Models and Methods gave insight into how the diffusion equation
                can be utilized to estimate concentrations as described by Gaussian models such as TADPUFF and
                TADPLUME. The diffusion equations selected for use in this project originate from the
                TADPLUME and TADPUFF models. These models both use dispersion coefficients called sigma
                y and z (ùúéùë¶, ùúéùëß) to estimate the seven different EPA defined atmospheric stability classes. These
                coefficients are based on experimental results and are specified in the EPA Workbook of
                Atmospheric Dispersion Estimates.</p>
                <p>The models are used to estimate radiological material
                concentrations near a point of release (TADPLUME) and a distance far from the release
                (TADPUFF). Two models are needed because the TADPLUME model is not accurate from a
                distance. As for the equations, in addition to the dispersion coefficients, other parameters needed
                include the radiation rate of release (Q), wind speed (Œº), off-center axis coordinates (y, x), release
                height (h), origin axis coordinates (x0, y0), and atmospheric mixing lid (H). The equations used in
                both of the Gaussian models are shown below.</p>
